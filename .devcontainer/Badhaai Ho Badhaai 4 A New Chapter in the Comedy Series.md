Badhaai Ho Badhaai 4 is also one of the rare films in Bollywood that portrays polyamory in a positive light. Polyamory is the practice of having multiple intimate relationships with the knowledge and consent of everyone involved. It is also known as ethical or consensual non-monogamy. Polyamory is often misunderstood and stigmatized in India, where the norm is monogamy and marriage. However, there are many people who identify as polyamorous and seek to live authentically and honestly with their partners.[^2^]
 
The film explores the challenges and joys of being polyamorous in a society that is not very accepting of it. The film shows how the four main characters navigate their personal and professional lives, their family and social pressures, their emotional and sexual needs, and their love and respect for each other. The film also addresses the legal and social issues that polyamorous people face in India, such as inheritance rights, adoption rights, domestic violence laws, and discrimination.[^1^]
 
Badhaai Ho Badhaai 4 is a bold and refreshing film that celebrates diversity and inclusivity in love and relationships. The film aims to break stereotypes and myths about polyamory and create awareness and empathy among the audience. The film also hopes to inspire more people to embrace their true selves and find happiness in their own way.[^4^]
